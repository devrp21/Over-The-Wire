# OverTheWire Bandit CTF ‚Äì Level 32

## üèÜ **Goal**  
The goal of Bandit Level 32 is to break out of a restricted shell environment and retrieve the password for **bandit33**.

---

## üöÄ **Steps to Solve**

### 1. **Connect via SSH**  
Use the password obtained from Level 31 to log into **bandit32** using SSH:

```bash
ssh bandit32@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

- **Username:** bandit32  
- **Hostname:** bandit.labs.overthewire.org  
- **Port:** 2220  

When prompted, enter the password from Level 31:

```

```

---

### 2. **Restricted Shell Detected**  
When you log in, you'll notice that **normal commands** like `ls`, `cat`, and `whoami` may not work. This indicates that you're in a restricted shell environment.  

Trying common commands like:

```bash
ls
help
```

Results in output like:

```
-bash: ls: command not found
```

---

### 3. **Escape the Restricted Shell**  
You can try to escape the restricted shell using the `$0` variable, which holds the reference to the shell:

```bash
$0
```

This should drop you into a normal shell environment.

---

### 4. **Check Permissions and Files**  
Now that you're in a normal shell, list the contents of the home directory:

```bash
ls -la
```

Example output:
```
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Mar 8 12:34 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Mar 8 12:34 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   36 Mar 8 12:34 README
```

---

### 5. **Find the Password File**  
Use `whoami` to confirm your user:

```bash
whoami
```

Navigate to the `/etc/bandit_pass` directory:

```bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
```

Example output:
```
tQdtbs5D5i2vJwkO8mEyYEyTL8izoeJ0
```

---

## üîë **Password for Next Level**  
The password for **Level 33** is:

```
tQdtbs5D5i2vJwkO8mEyYEyTL8izoeJ0
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Summary**  
‚úîÔ∏è Connected to the server using SSH.  
‚úîÔ∏è Bypassed restricted shell using `$0`.  
‚úîÔ∏è Retrieved the password for the next level.
